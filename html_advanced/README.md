# Project Name: HTML Semantic Webpage from Figma Design  

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a semantic and well-structured HTML webpage from a provided Figma design. The goal is to translate the design into pure HTML without incorporating any styles or CSS. This foundational step ensures accessibility, maintainability, and clarity in your HTML code while adhering to semantic web principles.

---

## Objectives  
- Create a fully functional HTML structure based on the provided Figma design.  
- Use semantic HTML tags to ensure a well-structured and accessible webpage.  
- Understand and interpret design elements from Figma and translate them into proper HTML code.  
- Familiarize yourself with Figma as a design tool and explore its features like “Duplicate to Drafts” and font usage.

## Resources  
1. **Figma File**  
   - Access the design [here]([index.html](https://www.figma.com/design/pVbMZZmRniszMLzucPDTel/Holberton-School---Headphone-company--Copy-?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=5IvepKEguSHPvu2r-1)).  
   - Duplicate the file to your drafts for detailed inspection of the design.

2. **Fonts**  
   - Ensure your system includes the necessary fonts:  
     - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
     - [Spin Cycle OT](insert-link)  

3. **Rounding Values**  
   - Some dimensions in the Figma design may use floating-point values. Round them appropriately when defining dimensions or spacing in the HTML structure.

---

## Deliverables  
- A single HTML file (`index.html`) with semantic tags that replicate the design's structure.  
- Use elements such as `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and others where appropriate.  
- Include meaningful comments in the code to document the structure and functionality.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
1. Install a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).  
2. Familiarize yourself with Figma. Create an account if you don't already have one.  

### Steps  
1. Open the Figma file and analyze the layout.  
2. Plan the structure of your HTML document, including:  
   - The `<head>` section for metadata.  
   - Semantic tags for each section of the design.  
3. Write clean, formatted HTML code.  
4. Validate your HTML using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
