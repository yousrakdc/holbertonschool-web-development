![smileschool](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/563c0098-8b9e-4818-9736-bd2fa765ca97)

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a fully functional webpage based on a provided Figma design. The goal is to translate the design into a semantic HTML structure, styled with CSS, ensuring alignment with modern web standards for accessibility, maintainability, and responsiveness.

---

## Objectives  
- Recreate the provided Figma design using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- Ensure semantic HTML structure for better accessibility and SEO.  
- Implement design styles and layouts using clean and well-organized CSS.  
- Maintain pixel-perfect alignment with the Figma design.  
- Familiarize yourself with Figma for inspecting design details, including fonts, colors, and spacing.

## Resources  

### 1. **Figma File**  
   - Access the design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/ZLmQdmm0zigB5XP3pLgTTH/Homepage-(Copy)?node-id=3558-0&node-type=frame&t=dCSPr9GIoiKez3Yo-0).  
   - Duplicate the file to your drafts for detailed inspection.  

### 2. **Fonts**  
   - Use the specified fonts to match the design:  
     - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
     - [Spin Cycle OT](insert-link)  

### 3. **Color Palette and Spacing**  
   - Extract color codes, spacing, and dimensions from the Figma design using the design tool.

---

## Deliverables  
- A single HTML file (`index.html`) with semantic tags matching the design's structure.  
- A single CSS file (`style.css`) with well-organized styles for layout and design elements.  
- Ensure that the layout is responsive (if required by the design).  
- Include meaningful comments in both HTML and CSS files for clarity.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
1. Install a text editor like **Visual Studio Code** or **Sublime Text**.  
2. Familiarize yourself with Figma for design inspection.  
3. Set up a basic development environment with a browser for testing.  

### Steps  

1. **Analyze the Figma Design**  
   - Open the Figma file and inspect the layout, typography, and spacing.  
   - Take note of all the design elements, such as header, footer, buttons, and sections.  

2. **Create the HTML Structure**  
   - Use semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.  
   - Plan and comment on the structure for easy readability and maintainability.  

3. **Style with CSS**  
   - Link your CSS file to the HTML.  
   - Use external stylesheets and follow a modular approach for organizing your CSS (e.g., typography, layout, components).  
   - Implement the design specifications for spacing, alignment, colors, and fonts.  

4. **Test and Validate**  
   - Ensure your webpage is pixel-perfect by comparing it to the Figma design.  
   - Test responsiveness (if required).  
   - Validate your HTML and CSS using tools like:  
     - [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  
     - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
